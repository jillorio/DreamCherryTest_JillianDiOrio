<h1>This Ancient Roman “Dream Cherry” Gives You<br>An Extra <span style="color:#FF0000;">84 Minutes of Deep Sleep</span> Every Night</h1>
    
<p><strong>PLUS: Over the age of 50? Watch below for the <u>scientifically verified solution</u> to your sleep problems…</strong></p>
<p>Hello. I’m <strong>Dr. Richard Gerhauser.</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to ask you a question. And I apologize if it’s a bit <strong>personal</strong>…</p>
<p><strong><em>How are you sleeping these days?</em></strong></p>
<p>Meaning, when was the last time you woke up in the morning feeling truly…<strong>re-</strong></p>
<p><strong>freshed?</strong></p>
<p>Like your batteries were <strong>completely recharged?</strong></p>
<p>And when’s the last time you sat up in bed, bright-eyed and <strong>bursting with en-</strong></p>
<p><strong>ergy…</strong></p>
<p>…like waking up on <strong>the first day of summer vacation </strong>when you were a kid?</p>
<p><strong>How long since you’ve had that feeling?</strong></p>
<p>Has it been a while? <em>A decade—or even more?</em></p>
<p>Well, despite what you may think… it’s <strong>not your fault.</strong></p>
<p id="bold"><strong>I’m here to show you my scientifically verified way to reclaim that restful sleep<br>(night after night)…</strong></p>

<!––end first page––>
<!––second page––>
<p>AND boundless energy (day after day)…</p>
<p>In fact, with what I’m about to show you…<em>just days from now…</em></p>
<p><strong><em>You could start enjoying a full 84 minutes MORE deep, restful sleep <u>every</u></em></strong></p>
        <p><strong><em><u>night.</u></em></strong></p>
<p>The fact is: If you’re like most of my patients over the age of 50…</p>
<p>You’re not getting even <u>close</u> to the hours of <strong>quality sleep</strong> you used to.</p>
<p>You go to bed, <strong>but you can’t fall asleep.</strong></p>
<p>Your mind keeps churning and nagging worries creep in… making it tough to </p>
<p>drift off.</p>
<p>And, when you do fall asleep, <strong>you can’t STAY asleep.</strong></p>
<p>Inevitably, you wake up… <strong>wide awake.</strong></p>
<p>Like your body is saying it’s time to get up.<strong> But it’s not</strong>…</p>
<p>It’s still <strong>the middle of the night.</strong></p>
<p>Dawn is hours away… you feel drained, but <strong>you can’t fall back asleep</strong>…</p>
<p>Or sometimes it’s your <strong>bladder</strong>… or frustrating <strong>aches</strong> and <strong>pains</strong>…<em> that wake</em></p>
<p><em>you up…</em> make you toss and turn…</p>
<p>And then it’s nearly <strong>impossible to get back to sleep…</strong> </p>
<p>Whether it’s one of these problems or <strong><em>all of them…</em></strong> the results are the <strong>same.</strong></p>
<p>Every morning you feel drowsy, red-eyed… <strong>just plain exhausted.</strong></p>

<p>Sound all too familiar?</p>
<p>As a doctor, I can assure you – what you’re experiencing isn’t something “you just have to live with at your age”…</p>
<p>Because if you watch this presentation and try my method… we’ll finally be able to fix your sleep problems—FOR GOOD. </p>
<div class="contentbox2">
<p id="bold"><strong>It all happens by resetting your sleep cycle,<br> then your new, healthy sleep will be on auto-pilot</strong></p>
</div>
<p>You see, when you don’t sleep well—even for just one night—<strong>your body and brain</strong> aren’t able to “recharge”…</p>
<p>So you <strong>barely</strong> have the energy to get through your daily routine, <em>much less do the fun, social activities you used to enjoy…</em></p>
<p>Sure, you might be able to squeak by that way… but, be honest, does it feel </p>
<p>good?</p>
<p>Or even normal?</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve even tried sleep aids before – and found they don’t really work?</p>
<p>I’m not surprised.</p>
<p>They never actually get to the <em>root</em> of your problems… so they’re a complete waste of money.</p>
<p>Here’s the truth I’ve been telling my senior patients for more than 20 years now:</p>
<p>The reason sleep aids don’t work is because…</p>
<div class="contentbox2">
<p id="bold"><strong>There are <u>3 separate issues</u> affecting seniors<br> and making it near impossible for you to get deep “recharging” sleep…</strong></p>
</div>
<p>I call them the <strong>3 Sleep Stealers.</strong></p>
<p>Before we get started, let’s identify how many you might have now…</p>

<!––end third page––>
<!––fourth page––>
    
<p><u>Sleep Stealer #1</u>:<strong> When you go to bed, does your “racing” mind keep you from falling asleep quickly?</strong></p>
<p>I know that feeling too, and I’m about to show you a special technique that works like a “light dimmer” to gently calm your brain and help you fall asleep in HALF the time.</p>
<p><u>Sleep Stealer #2</u>: <strong>Has your body STOPPED “making sleep”?</strong></p>
<p>That may sound a little weird, but keep watching and I’ll show you a quick way</p>
<p>to check.</p>
<p>After all, if you often find yourself <strong>awake during the night…</strong> </p>
<p>Or <strong>wake up far too early</strong> in the morning…</p>
<p>Then your body may have stopped “making sleep.”</p>
<p>It happens to a lot of people as they get older.</p>
<p>Luckily, there’s an easy way to fix it. I’ll explain everything in a moment. </p>
<p>But first…</p>
<p><u>Sleep Stealer #3</u>:<strong> Do you have any nighttime annoyances</strong>, like getting up to pee or pain that keeps you awake? </p>
<p>This is the BIGGEST complaint I hear from my patients, but luckily the solution to keeping the pesky wake-up calls at bay is so simple…</p>
<p>Maybe <strong><u>all 3</u></strong> of these “Sleep Stealers” sound familiar?</p>
<p>These issues are the real reason why you have such trouble sleeping…</p>
<p>And that’s what makes my solution different than anything else you might’ve tried before.</p>
<p>I’m about to share with you the same thing I tell my patients…</p>

<p>Fall asleep in <strong><u>half</u></strong> the time…</p>

<p>In fact, these 3 simple steps are so powerful, they’re…</p>
<p>…scientifically verified to give <strong>an EXTRA <u>84 minutes of sleep</u></strong> every night.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that… follow these 3 scientifically verified steps…</p>
<p>And you’ll enjoy almost <strong>an hour and a half MORE sleep every single night</strong>.</p>

<p>The truth is,</p>
<div class="contentbox2">
<p id="bold"><strong>I see almost no bigger change in quality of life and health for seniors than<br> when they follow my 3-step protocol and <em>reset their sleep cycle</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>And when you do it yourself… pretty soon, you’ll have your own moment.</p>
<p>Picture this…</p>
<p>You’re getting ready for bed.</p>
<p>You slip under the blankets, switch off the light… and close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Your mind is calm</strong>. You’re not worried or anxious…</p>
<p>You feel at peace.</p>
<p>In just a few minutes you drift off to sleep… <em>without a care in the world…</em></p>
<p>Then… before you know it… <strong>you open your eyes</strong>.</p>
<p>You blink in the morning sun streaming through your windows.</p>
<p>You suddenly realize: <strong>You slept straight through the night</strong>.</p>
<p>You didn’t get up to use the restroom… you didn’t wake up because of aching joints or a sore back…</p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<div class="contentbox2">
<p id="bold"><strong>You just experienced the deepest, most refreshing night’s sleep you can<br> remember…</strong></p>
</div>
<p>So you swing your legs over the side of the bed… <strong><em>eager to start your day</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You’re full of energy</strong>. Your mind is <u>crystal clear</u>.</p>

<!––seventh page––>
    
<p>Heck, you might just skip your usual morning coffee and plunge right into your </p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>You can’t believe how great… <strong>how YOUNG</strong>… you feel.</p>
<p>Just imagine if you felt that way <u>every morning</u> from now on.</p>
<p><strong>You can.</strong></p>
<p><em>And I guarantee it.</em></p>
<p>All you need to do is “reset your sleep cycle” in 3 easy steps…</p>
<p>So let’s get started right now.</p>
<p>And don’t worry about memorizing this or taking notes. At the end of this presentation I’ll make the full protocol available for you…</p>
<p>Ok, let’s jump right in with <strong>Step 1</strong>:</p>
<div class="contentbox2">
<p id="bold"><strong>How to get <em>10 EXTRA hours of sleep every week</em> thanks to my best sleep<br> secret:<br> An <u>Ancient Roman cherry</u></strong></p>
</div>
<p>It’s shown to give you <strong>an extra 84 minutes of deep, restful sleep every night.</strong></p>
<p>Ever heard of the <strong>Roman Dream Cherry</strong>?</p>
<p>Here’s a picture.</p>
<img src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/health/SOL/dreamcherry_0418/cherries.jpg" alt="Four Cherries" width="150" height="100">
<p>They look a lot like the “normal” cherries we’re used to seeing in the supermar-</p>
<p>ket, don’t they?</p>
    
<!––end seventh page––>
<!––eighth page––>
    
<p>Actually, what you’re seeing is a very <strong>rare and special kind of cherry</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s an <strong>exotic fruit</strong> that goes all the way back to ancient Rome.</p>
<p>And science has FINALLY caught on… the ancient Dream Cherry is a <strong>God-send for seniors</strong> who have trouble sleeping…</p>
<p>Just listen to this: Recently, a study was conducted on a small group of <strong>seniors with serious sleeping challenges</strong>…</p>
<p>Some of the volunteers drank a cup of <strong>Dream Cherry</strong> juice every day…</p>
<p>The rest of the volunteers were given a <strong>placebo</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>After just 14 days</strong>, all of the volunteers were tested using something called a polysomnographic sleep study. (That’s just a fancy sleep monitoring system.)</p>
<p>That way, they could <strong>accurately</strong> test if Dream Cherry helped people sleep bet-</p>
<p>ter.</p>
<p>And when they got the results, the scientists couldn’t believe their eyes.</p>
